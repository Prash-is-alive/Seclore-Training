Java IO is divided into two main parts:
  Byte Stream & Character Stream
    -> Byte Stream is used to read binary data
    -> Character stream is used to read character data (supports unicode).

Byte Stream is further divided into two:
    Input Stream 
    -> File input stream (too slow since reads only one byte at a time)
    -> Buffered input stream (wrapper to the file input stream, reads data in the form of a buffer)
    
    Output Stream
    -> FIle output stream
    -> Buffered output stream

Character Stream is also further divided into two:
    Reader
    -> File reader
    -> Buffered File reader
    
    Writer
    -> File Writer
    -> Buffered File Writer

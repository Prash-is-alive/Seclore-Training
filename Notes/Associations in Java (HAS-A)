Composition & Aggregation associations in Java

-Both are 'HAS-A' relationship associations

-Composition (Strong Association)
   - One class owns another class. (Tightly Coupled)
   - If the parent is destroyed then the child also gets destroyed.
   - Objects cannot exist independently.

ex.
class Engine{
    void start(){
        syso("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car{
    private Engine engine;

    Car(){
        engine = new Engine();
    }

    void startCar(){
        engine.start();
        syso("car started!");
    }
}

public class Composition Example{
    psvm(String[] args){
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();
        //if the car object is destroyed then the engine is also automatically destoryed.
    }
}

- Aggregation (Weak Association)
  - The objects can live without one another.
ex. Student & departments.

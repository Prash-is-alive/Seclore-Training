	- There are two subclasses derived from throwable error and exceptions
	-Error
		Generally used for reporting system level errors.
		The maximum size of the array is Integer.MAX_VALUE - 2147483647.
		Errors are not meant to be caught in the program. we will not be able to handle them at the runtime most likely.

	-Exceptions

The compiler checks only the syntax not the logic.

There are two types of Exceptions, checked and unchecked.
checked
- compiler checks if the exceiption is handled or not.
- Exception class and it's subclasses are cheecked in nature.
- ex. IOException, SQLException.
reallife example: fire extingusher.

unchecked
- compiler does not checks if the exceiption is handled or not.
- from Exception class, a special subclass by the name RuntimeExceiption is derived.
- RuntimeException and it's subclasses are unchecked in nature.
-ex. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundExeption, NullPointerException, ArithmeticException...

In almost all the other lang. all the exceptions are unchecked by default.

-- RuntimeException e = new RuntimeException("Insufficient Balance!");
if you throw a runtime exception then you don't need to specify the throws in the signature.

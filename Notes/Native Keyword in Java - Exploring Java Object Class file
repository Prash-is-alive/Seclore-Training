Native Keyword in java.

- native keyword in java is used for methods which have do defination in java by itself, instead it is written in other low level lang like C/C++.
- This is done to achieve efficiency. Since C/C++ may have better hardware level access than java. so the hardware level implementation/ functions are written in C/C++,
  then it is used in java using the native keyword. the Java Native Interface (JNI) helps in resolving such cases.

Key Points About native Keyword:
- It is used to declare methods whose implementation is provided in native code (C/C++).
- Such methods interact with the Java Native Interface (JNI).
- Native methods do not have a method body in Java.

example: 
-- 1. Declaring a Native Method
public class NativeExample {
    // Native method declaration
    public native void displayMessage();

    // Load the native library
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("NativeLib");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NativeExample example = new NativeExample();
        example.displayMessage(); // Calls the native method
    }
}

-- 2. Native Method Implementation in C (JNI - Java Native Interface)
#include <jni.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "NativeExample.h"

JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_NativeExample_displayMessage(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj) {
    printf("Hello from C!\n");
}

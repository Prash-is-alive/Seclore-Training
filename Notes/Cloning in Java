Cloning in Java

1. Introduction to Cloning
- Cloning in Java creates an exact copy of an object using the Cloneable interface and the clone() method.

2. Types of Cloning
-- Shallow Cloning: Copies primitive fields but references the same objects for non-primitive fields.
-- Deep Cloning: Recursively clones all objects, creating completely independent copies.

3. Implementing Cloning
+ Shallow Cloning Example

class Address {
    String street, city;
    Address(String street, String city) { this.street = street; this.city = city; }
    public String toString() { return street + ", " + city; }
}

class Person implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    int age;
    Address address;
    Person(String name, int age, Address address) {
        this.name = name; this.age = age; this.address = address;
    }
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();
    }
}

+ Deep Cloning Example

class Person implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    int age;
    Address address;
    Person(String name, int age, Address address) {
        this.name = name; this.age = age; this.address = address;
    }
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Person cloned = (Person) super.clone();
        cloned.address = new Address(this.address.street, this.address.city);
        return cloned;
    }
}

+ Using Copy Constructor

class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    Address address;
    Person(String name, int age, Address address) {
        this.name = name; this.age = age; this.address = address;
    }
    // copy constructor of person
    Person(Person other) {
        this.name = other.name; this.age = other.age;
        this.address = new Address(other.address.street, other.address.city);
    }
}

4. Flaws of Cloning
- Complexity: Requires overriding clone() and implementing Cloneable.
- Performance: Deep cloning is expensive.
- Immutability Risk: Cloning can break immutability.

5. Alternatives to Cloning
- Copy Constructors (as shown above).
- Factory Methods to create copies.
- Serialization for deep cloning.

6. Conclusion
- Cloning helps copy objects but has limitations. Use alternative methods when possible for better control and efficiency.

--- Don't want to make an Object of a Class?
- make it's contructor private.
But can we achieve this by making the class as an abstract class?
- Making the class an abstract can prevent creating the object of that abstract class, but it will forward this reponsibility to the sub-classes.
- making the constructor of a class as private will strictly prevent the object creation. object of that class or it's subclasses cannot be created.--
-- where to use this feature?
public class MathUtils {
    private MathUtils() {} // Prevent instantiation

    public static int square(int num) {
        return num * num;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // MathUtils obj = new MathUtils(); // ❌ Not allowed
        System.out.println(MathUtils.square(5)); // ✅ Prints: 25
    }
}

--- StringBuffers will have a capacity of 16 at the start. after that they will keep an extra continuous space of 16 characters. 
    This is done so that the append and other operations can be done on the same string (array) easily.
    Later on, with increasing size, the size of the buffer (array) is dynamically increased by the JVM.

--- While doing, 
String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "World";
String newStr = str1 + str2;
- The '+' operation internally uses StringBuffer for appending.
- The compiler converts the above program to 
    => newStr = new StringBuffer().append(str1).append(str2).toString();
The native append operation is slow (even after using buffer in the back),
since appending multiple strings creats more and more objects of buffer in the back. 
This slows slows down the performance since many useless buffer objects are created.

--- Does Java use pass by value or pass by reference?
- By default java uses pass by value. 
- If you see something like this: 
    void someMethod(SomeObject obj);
- then we are not passing the reference to that object. 
    Instead, we are passing the location of that object as the value to that function.

---  which classes are immutable in Java
- By default all the Wrapper classes are Immutable in Java.
- List, Sets & Maps are also immutable. Whereas their implementations (ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.) are mutable.
- some other classes like Date & Time classes are also immutable.

--- when to use StringBuffer vs StringBuilder?
- use StringBuffer when you are dealing with multiple threads.
    All the methods of StringBuffer are 'Synchronized'.
    Only one thread can access the method at a time.
    This makes them 'Thread Safe'.
    It also makes the process a bit slow.

- use StringBuilder when dealing with single thread.
    no methods here are 'Synchronized'.
    this makes them very fast compared to buffers.
    Hence, they are not 'Thread Safe'.

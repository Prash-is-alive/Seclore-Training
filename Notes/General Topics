Don't want to make an Object of a Class?
- make it's contructor private.
But can we achieve this by making the class as an abstract class?
- Making the class an abstract can prevent creating the object of that abstract class, but it will forward this reponsibility to the sub-classes.
- making the constructor of a class as private will strictly prevent the object creation. object of that class or it's subclasses cannot be created.--
-- where to use this feature?
public class MathUtils {
    private MathUtils() {} // Prevent instantiation

    public static int square(int num) {
        return num * num;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // MathUtils obj = new MathUtils(); // ❌ Not allowed
        System.out.println(MathUtils.square(5)); // ✅ Prints: 25
    }
}

What is a servlet?
- A servlet is a java file that can handle requests and process that request to generate a response and send it to the client in the form of HTML (or other formats).

- Client-Server model.
Client sends request -> server gets the request and processes it -> server sends the response.

2 Types of pages 
-- Static Pages
    - Already generated pages (predefined HTML) , that are sent directly on the request.
-- Dynamic Pages
    - Generated on the fly, while request processing.
    
    How Dynamic pages are loaded?
    -> The client sends req to the server -> the server does not have the page ready -> the request is forwarded to the web container -> web container runs the appropriate servlet and generates the response.
    
    What's a web container? 
    -> A runtime environment that manages the servlets. 
      eg. Tomcat, GlassFish, JBoss, webSphere, etc.
      It uses a deployment descriptor (web.xml) file for storing the configurations.
      - it maps the requested url to the appropriate servlet file.

for creating a servlet file, create a java class that extends HttpServlet class and override the doGet or doPost method to get started.

HttpServlet, HttpServletRequest , HttpServletResponse are java interfaces, which are implemented by the apache tomcat.
that's the reason we install apache tomcat server.

we have 2 types of servers:
Web servers -> tomcat, glassfish.
application servers -> JBoss, etc.
application servers are more advanced than web servers.

tomcat can have many containers like-> 
servlet container
JSP container
security container
webSocket container
JNDI container

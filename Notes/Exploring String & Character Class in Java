- codePointAt(int idx)
  A code point is just an abstract number that represents a character.
  This will return the unicode value of that character present at that index.
  eg. "a".codePointAt(0); will print the unicode value of a i.e. 65.

UNICODE A->65 a->97
- A single character takes 1 code point
- An Emoji takes 2 code points.
- In Java length of a string is measured in UTF-16 code points.
-- Surrogate pairs are used only in UTF-16 (not UTF-8 or UTF-32).
-- They combine 2 unicodes to form a character beyond u+ffff.
